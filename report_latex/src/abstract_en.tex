ML models are widely used, but their reliability and validity are just being explored. 
Safety of Machine Learning models is being asked now more than ever. 
Advanced deep learning models possess the capability to produce overconfident predictions, 
which can result in severe consequences. 
Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection can identify if an input is in-distribution (ID) or OOD, 
and thus reducing inaccurate predictions.  
This work offers a comprehensive overview of various methods, trends and key-concepts in multi-label OOD detection, 
which continues to be an under-explored area of research. 
Some approaches were implemented and evaluated using on same setting on three public datasets to allow for quantitative comparison.
